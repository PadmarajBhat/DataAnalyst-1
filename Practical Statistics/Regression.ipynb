    "# Regression:\n",
    "* Linear Regression emphasis relation betweeen 2 variables and tries to fit relation through a line. Y = mX + C, X is the independent variable and Y is the dependent variable and C is the bias normalizer.\n",
    "* Scatter Plot and Corelation coefficients are the popular metrics to determine relation beween 2 variables/features.\n",
    "* Scatter plot would have x axis as independent and y axis as the one where would like to see the pattern of the target/dependent variable. It also indicates the direction of dependency.\n",
    "* Corelation coefficients are the values between -1 to 1. where negative indicates indirect co relation and values closer to -1 and 1 indicates the max strength of the co relation."
